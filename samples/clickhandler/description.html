<p>This example shows how DOM events can be simply handled in Hashspace: for this you have to use a function expression that refers to a function that can be reached in the template scope:</p>

<p>In this example the event handler function - <em>changeMessage</em> - will change the message object used by the template instance, and of course the data-binding engine will automatically update the DOM once all JavaScript instructions are executed.</p>
<p>This example also shows how to insert conditional DOM content through an <em>{if}</em> statement. This conditional statement can be used to insert new nodes or simply text. On contrary to many template engines, Hashspace doesn&#39;t force you to create an HTML container element to include conditional content.</p>
