<p>This example is also borrowed from <a href="http://facebook.github.io/react/">react framework</a> documentation and shows a basic todo list implementation:</p>
[#output]
<p>Here the argument passed to the template is a small controller object that exposes:</p>
<ul>
<li>the todo list data model - composed for this example of a simple list, and of a property to store the todo item that is being created</li>
<li>the action that can be performed on this data model - in this case the <em>addItem</em> method.</li>
</ul>
<p>Using a controller object offers the possibility to support multiple instances of the same template in the same page - of course on condition that the template doesn&#39;t use fixed html ids.</p>
<p>A more complete implementation of the todo example can be found <a href="/todomvc/">here</a> (should be soon part of the <a href="http://todomvc.com/">todomvc</a> site) - code is available on <a href="https://github.com/ariatemplates/hashspace/tree/master/docs/todomvc">github</a></p>
