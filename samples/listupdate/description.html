<p>This example shows how a list implemented with a <em>foreach</em> loop can be dynamically updated: simply click on the links at the top of the example to add, delete or replace some elements.</p>
[#output]
<p>As you can see, the list update is automatically managed by the data-binding engine. For this you simply need to update the list array with one of the standard JavaScript methods that mutate arrays:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array/splice">splice</a>: to add and remove multiple elements in one single operation</li>
<li><a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array/push">push</a>: to append new elements to the array</li>
<li><a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array/pop">pop</a>: to remove and get the last element of an array</li>
<li><a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array/shift">shift</a>: to remove and get the first element of an array</li>
<li><a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array/unshift">unshift</a>: to insert new elements at the beginning of an array</li>
<li><a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array/reverse">reverse</a>: to reverse the array element order</li>
<li><a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array/sort">sort</a>: to sort array elements according to a sort function</li>
<li>splice2: which behaves as <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array/splice">splice</a> but that takes an array of items as 3rd argument - on the contrary to splice() that requires items to be passed as independent arguments (cf. example). Note: this method is not part of ECMAScript, but is automatically added to the Array prototype by Hashspace.</li>
</ul>
<p>Technically those methods have been overridden on the Array object prototype so that the binding engine can detect the changes and automatically trigger template updates. </p>
